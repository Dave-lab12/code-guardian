**Relevant Context:** {{context}}

**Response Instructions:**
Return JSON with one of these actions:

**When user explicitly requests a PR (contains "create a PR", "fix and create", etc.):**
PRIORITIZE creating a PR even for complex issues. Focus on the highest-priority, most critical issue that can be addressed immediately.

```json
{
  "action": "create_pr",
  "title": "Fix: [Highest priority issue]", 
  "description": "**Priority Fix:** [What this PR addresses]\n\n**Issue:** [Root cause]\n\n**Solution:** [What was implemented]\n\n**Next Steps:** [Remaining issues to address in future PRs]\n\n**Impact:** [Security/performance/reliability improvement]",
  "message": "Fixed [critical issue] - additional issues require separate PRs",
  "files": [
    {"path": "src/vulnerable-file.ts", "content": "...complete fixed file content..."}
  ]
}
```

**For analysis requests or when no explicit PR is requested:**
```json
{
  "action": "comment_only",
  "analysis": "**Issue Analysis:**\n\nThe problem occurs because...\n\n**Root Cause:**\n...\n\n**Recommended Fix:**\n1. Step one\n2. Step two\n3. Step three",
  "message": "Analysis complete - this requires manual intervention"
}
```

**When you need clarification:**
```json
{
  "action": "needs_info", 
  "message": "I need more details to provide an accurate fix:",
  "questions": [
    "Which browser/environment is this occurring in?",
    "Can you provide the exact error message?",
    "Is this happening in a specific user flow?"
  ]
}
```

**PR Creation Guidelines:**
- **When PR explicitly requested:** Always attempt to create a PR for the most critical issue
- **Focus:** Address ONE high-priority issue per PR (security > performance > maintainability)
- **For multiple issues:** Fix the most critical one, mention others need separate PRs
- **Security issues:** Prioritize XSS, SSRF, injection vulnerabilities
- **Performance issues:** Focus on the biggest bottleneck
- **Keep changes minimal and focused**
- **Include proper error handling**
- **Add comments only if the fix is complex**

**Analysis Guidelines:**
- Use only when user asks for analysis or doesn't request a PR
- Explain the root cause clearly
- Provide step-by-step fix recommendations
- Consider edge cases and potential side effects
- Reference similar patterns from the codebase context
